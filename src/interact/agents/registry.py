"""On-disk record of every agent run: what is running, who started it, what it cost.

Cross-process by design — the CLI spawns, the VS Code extension reads, another shell stops. So
the directory is a FIXED ``~/.interact/out/agents``, never ``debug_dir``-relative: two processes
disagreeing about where to look is exactly how metering broke before (0ef5fa4), and
``server_registry`` pins its own path for the same reason.

Status is DERIVED from the pid on every read. A record cannot assert it is still running — a
killed agent reports as crashed instead of spinning forever in the UI.
