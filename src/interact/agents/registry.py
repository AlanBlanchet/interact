"""On-disk record of every agent run: what is running, who started it, what it cost.

Cross-process by design — the CLI spawns, the VS Code extension reads, another shell stops. The
default is ``~/.interact/out/agents``; disposable test and harness processes pass
``INTERACT_AGENTS_DIR`` to every participant so they share an isolated registry. It is never
``debug_dir``-relative: two processes disagreeing about where to look is exactly how metering
broke before (0ef5fa4), and ``server_registry`` pins its own path for the same reason.

Status is DERIVED from the pid on every read. A record cannot assert it is still running — a
killed agent reports as interrupted instead of spinning forever in the UI.
