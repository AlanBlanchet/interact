"""One normalised event shape across every agent provider.

Each vendor CLI streams its own JSON dialect; supervisor and dashboard must not learn all of
them. Providers translate into :class:`AgentEvent`, so a Claude run and a Codex run render
identically, and a new provider costs one adapter, not a new UI.

Unrecognised line becomes ``kind="other"`` rather than dropped — a vendor adding an event type

      one message's usage on every content-block line. Counted once per message key, so a
