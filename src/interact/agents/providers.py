"""Adapters for the agent CLIs interact can supervise.

**The legal boundary lives here.** interact builds an argv, spawns the vendor's own binary, and
reads its stdout. It never reads, stores, forwards or proxies a credential — the CLI
authenticates itself with the user's own login, on the user's own machine. Anthropic's terms
forbid third parties *routing requests through* Free/Pro/Max credentials, and an enforcement wave
in early 2026 hit tools that did; running the documented headless mode (`claude -p`, which
Anthropic markets for scripts and CI) is a different act entirely. Never add a "sign in with
Claude" flow, never read a credentials file, never expose an endpoint backed by a subscription.

Cross-provider work needs no bespoke protocol: every one of these CLIs is an MCP *client*, and
interact is an MCP *server*. Handing a spawned agent interact's own server config (``mcp_config``)
is what lets a Claude agent spawn a Codex agent — they meet on MCP, which is vendor-neutral.
