    Returns immediately by design: the supervisor's whole value is watching work in flight, so
    the run must be visible in the registry before it finishes.

    ``quota_window`` buys that promise back for a caller that can afford to wait: a vendor takes
    several seconds to answer "you've reached your limit", and a caller returning in four cannot
    fall through to the next candidate for a refusal that has not arrived yet. A human launching
    from the terminal waits; a supervisor watching in-flight work does not, so the default stays
    the short one (:func:`_quota_probe`).

    ``profile`` names one of the OPERATOR's own profiles (``INTERACT_PROFILE_*`` in config),
    deciding what this agent runs on — so the critic can sit on a local model while the reviewer
    stays frontier. Resolves through :mod:`interact.agents.profiles` to a fixed, allow-listed
    overlay; a caller cannot hand over an environment, because a model that can set
    ``LD_PRELOAD`` or ``PATH`` on the process it spawns has escaped every other guard here.

    ``parent_run_id`` defaults to ``INTERACT_PARENT_RUN_ID`` — set on a spawned agent's own MCP
    server by :func:`mesh_config` — so an agent spawning an agent produces a connected tree with
    nobody passing the id by hand.

    ``image_paths`` is an optional tuple of existing absolute PNG, JPEG, or WebP paths. The
    provider and resolved model are checked before any child process is created.

    ``provider`` None means the ranked choice: the role's criterion is ranked ONCE across every
    registered CLI (:func:`rank_candidates`) and the list is walked in order until a candidate
    can start here — installed, switched on, logged in, honouring the requested mode and
    attachments, AND not refused for quota or rate limit in the few seconds after it starts
    (:func:`_quota_probe`, #181) — the one failure only the provider itself can report, so it is
    checked moments after start rather than before. A named provider is the same list filtered
    to it and never falls through, quota included: the caller chose, so its failure is reported
    as such. Every other fall-through happens only BEFORE the child exists; whatever else
    happens once it can act — a denial, a crash, a stop — is that run's outcome and is never
    replayed on another candidate. Falling through never relaxes the criterion: the next
    candidate is still ranked under it, and every skip (quota included) is recorded on the run
    that finally started, naming which candidate ran and why each earlier one was passed over.
