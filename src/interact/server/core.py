"""Core of the ``interact`` MCP server package: the shared ``FastMCP`` instance every tool
registers on, the server lifespan, tool-facing instructions, the browser
:class:`SessionRegistry`, and small dependency-free helpers (path/mime/label formatting) every
other submodule leans on.

Split by COHESION — ``vlm``/``sandbox``/``targets``/``capture`` hold private helpers, ``tools_*``
hold the ``@mcp.tool`` surfaces — so no file is a 2000-line monolith. ``server/__init__``
re-exports the whole public + test-patched surface, so both ``srv._vlm`` and ``from
interact.server import _scan_elements`` keep resolving. Cross-module calls to a monkeypatched
helper are MODULE-QUALIFIED (``vlm._vlm(...)``) so a test patching it on its home module is
seen at the call site; same-module calls stay bare.
