"""Refresh the live external data the front ends read.

Three sources age the same way: the model catalog (prices, from OpenRouter/litellm), the overall
benchmark board (Artificial Analysis), and the per-benchmark leaderboard tables (OpenVLM and
friends — the vision / video / audio numbers AA does not publish). Each keeps a TTL cache on a
fixed path under ``~/.interact/out/`` that the CLI dashboard AND the VS Code extension READ
directly.

Both loaders shipped with no caller at all, so nothing ever refreshed them on a schedule: the
cache files existed only because a developer had run a loader by hand, and a fresh install had
none. Refreshing is nobody's job unless it is somebody's job, so it is this module's — wired into
the MCP server, the process alive whenever the user is working, and reachable on demand as
``interact refresh``, which is what the extension calls when its cache has aged out.

Python is the SOLE WRITER of these files. The extension used to fetch and write the catalog
itself with a narrower schema (no output prices), so whichever side wrote last decided whether
prices existed at all.

Adding a third source means one entry in ``SOURCES`` — never a new call site.
