"""Command rewriting + sizing for ``launch_app``, apart from the MCP tool module.

Each rewriter shares one job shape: inspect the command's executable, and if it matches a known
class, inject flags and return a note explaining what was added and why — the note reaches the
agent, so a launch that behaves unexpectedly explains itself. ``apply_launch_rewrites`` threads a
command through all of them.

The isolating rewriters (`_browser_isolate`, `_editor_isolate`) also PREPARE the profile they
point at — creating it and clearing a lock left by a dead process — so they touch the filesystem
rather than being pure argv transforms.
