"""#112: a `screenshot(query=...)` on a desktop window answered with the agent's own action text
("press ctrl+shift+p") wrapped in a full-frame bounding box, as if it had read it on screen.

The window had in fact CRASHED and the capture came back all black. Handed an empty image, the
model reconstructed something plausible from the prompt instead of reporting that there was
nothing to see — so the captioned path reported nothing-unusual while the app was dead. That is
the failure mode the reporter rightly called worse than an error: a well-formed, plausible,
completely wrong answer that reads as a real observation.

A blank frame is deterministically detectable, so it never needs a model's opinion. Detect it,
say so, and don't spend a VLM call inventing an answer about an empty image.
