"""launch_app must not accumulate ghost app instances in the shared sandbox.

- #92: repeated ``launch_app`` calls left FOUR live ``bundle/aino`` processes on one display; a
  capture then composited a stray element from an OLDER instance over the current app, and a
  "fresh" relaunch only added a fifth.
- #87: one ``launch_app`` call produced TWO process trees (a client-side retry of a slow launch),
  after which ``target="nested:<title>"`` silently swapped between two same-titled windows and
  ~20 actions landed on the wrong one.
- #118: an Electron app's helpers ``setsid`` out of the launcher's process group, so a group kill
  left them running — the old window stayed mapped holding its profile socket while ``launch_app``
  reported "Replaced N app(s)" from the PRE-kill count, and the next launch opened nothing.

All cured at the same place: the sandbox owns its children as PROCESS GROUPS, sweeps its own
display for what escaped them, reports what it actually killed, a relaunch replaces the previous
app by default, and an identical still-running command is not spawned twice.
