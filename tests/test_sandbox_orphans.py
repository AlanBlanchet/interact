"""Leaked Xephyr displays.

Two complaints, one cause. Every interact MCP server owns its own sandbox, so several servers
(one per editor window) means several Xephyr windows — "2 at the start". And when a server dies
without tearing down, its X server survives as an orphan: reparented to init, invisible to the
owner that could have cleaned it up, sitting on the user's screen until they kill it by hand.

An orphan is identifiable: it is OUR X server (our own flags), and its parent is gone.
