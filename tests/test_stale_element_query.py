"""#112 (second half): the reporter asked that the analysis path not be able to see text from
outside the frame it is describing — "anything that lets step text leak into 'what is on screen'
makes captions unfalsifiable".

There is a real instance of exactly that. `screenshot(target=<window>, element=N, query=...)`
crops the CURRENT frame at coordinates from a PREVIOUS detection and captions it with that older
widget's role and name, with no freshness check — while the sibling no-query branch right below it
already gates its refs on the frame's content signature (#19). So the model is handed a picture of
one thing labelled as another, which is the ideal setup for the confident wrong answer #112 is about.
