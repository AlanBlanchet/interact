"""interact must not drive the editor window that is hosting the caller.

An agent typing a command into its own editor can destroy the process issuing the command —
"Developer: Reload Window" ends the session mid-task, and nothing survives to notice or repair
it. This actually happened: a reload aimed at another window landed in the caller's own, and the
session died.

The blast radius of an action must never include the actor. So a desktop target that resolves to
the caller's own editor window is refused by default, with the reason and the escape hatch named.
