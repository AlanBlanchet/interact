"""The host-desktop tools on a REAL display, end to end through the MCP tool functions — the
session an agent ran with raw xdotool, redone with interact only:

    open a window → wait for it (no sleep) → click it → type into it with OS-level keys → wait until
    its result row READS "Results for whispering" (OCR) → Return → wait for it to be gone
    → list monitors → capture one monitor, one region, downscaled.

Linux: a PRIVATE Xvfb started here; DISPLAY is repointed for the test, so the user's own session
is never touched. Windows / macOS: the runner's real desktop, and only when
INTERACT_LIVE_DESKTOP=1 (set by CI) — a developer's full-suite run must not type into their screen.
