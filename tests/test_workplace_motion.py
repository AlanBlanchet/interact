# another team's colour for the whole walk. Invisible in every still frame of a standing team.

# The tile rewrite deleted the mechanism. A body now owns a tile coordinate and the element ITSELF
# moves — `wp-travelling`, `makeWalker` and the copied-property list are all gone from sim.ts. So

    deliberately bigger than it, so most of the cast is OUTSIDE the frame at any moment — and a
    clipped-away element still reports a full bounding box. That is how "artist" was found lying

    whole company, the diagnostic handle included. Whole numbers can only zoom IN. Seeing

    That defect had no symptom a screenshot could catch. Everybody was on the floor and nobody was
    in a wall; the placement was simply MEANINGLESS — two ranks that collapsed onto the same row in
    any depth-6 room, an overflow rule that pushed the extra bodies one row NORTH onto the desks
    they were meant to be working at, and a "rest" rank standing three tiles from the nearest thing
    to sit on. Nothing throws, so nothing failed, and by the time it is visible in pixels it is one
    frame of a simulation that never holds still.

    So the rule is checked against the BUILT WORLD, where it is one line: a place is defined by
    what is behind it. Every place that claims something to sit on must have a desk, a couch or a
    bench on the tile directly north of it; a place with nothing declares `perch: false` and its
    occupant is drawn standing. A seat that can say neither is the bug.

    The first two rounds fixed real things — grounds furnished from the indoor kit, a shadow that
    was the prop's grid merely translated rather than projected — and neither was the cause. The

    canopy's shade came to rest behind its own trunk and only a bar at the waist escaped. Every
    earlier check asked "does it touch?" and none asked "which way does it go?".

    It survived two rounds because the symptom compresses: a 3-row glow and an 8-row tree threw the
    IDENTICAL 3-row shadow. When a table reads the same for every row, the quantity is not being
    expressed at all.
