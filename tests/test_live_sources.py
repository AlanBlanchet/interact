"""Both live data sources — the model catalog (prices) and the benchmark board (scores) — are
written to a fixed cache path that the VS Code extension reads DIRECTLY. Each had a loader with
the same TTL semantics and, in production, NO CALLER: the cache files only ever existed because a
developer ran the loader by hand. The panel therefore showed data that could never refresh, and a
fresh install showed none at all.

They are two instances of one shape — a live external source behind a TTL cache a front end
reads — so they refresh through one path, and adding a third source must not need a new call site.
