"""`wait` accepts a DURATION on every action, not only bare seconds (#97, #63).

`wait: "8s"` worked on navigate, but `wait: "1500ms"` on a click fell through to
`Page.wait_for_selector` and threw `Unexpected token "1500ms" while parsing css selector`. One
field carrying two grammars is easy to trip over mid-batch, so every duration literal an agent
plausibly writes is parsed as a duration; a selector still means a selector. The pure grammar
lives in `_parse_wait_seconds`; `srv._wait` is the integration point that consults it (a bare
number sleeps, a selector still waits for visibility).

The `WaitForAction` step itself has the same shape: client logs (2x/24h) hit a hard pydantic
error on `{"type":"wait_for","timeout":2000,"selector":null}` — a bare `wait_for` means "pause
for `timeout` ms" on any surface, not a validation failure.
