"""Register a run for the registry and messaging test suites.

`test_agent_registry.py` and `test_agent_messaging.py` each carried their own `_record` factory
around `interact.agents.registry.register`, with drifted defaults (the registry suite cared about
`pid`/`cwd`, the messaging suite about `pid`/`agent`/`provider_session_id`) but the same shape.
One typed factory covers both call sites; a caller only names what its scenario needs.
