/** THE SPINDLE — the sidebar as the paperwork on your desk, not as a list of your agents.
 *
 *  The conventional answer to "show me my agents in a side bar" is a list of cards: an avatar, a
 *  name, a coloured status dot, a spinner, an elapsed time on the right. Every agent extension
 *  ships it, which is exactly the singularity check failing — it is what anyone would draw for ANY
 *  project, so it cannot be the answer for THIS one.
 *
 *  The second answer, once you know the workplace exists, is to shrink the workplace: a little
 *  cutaway building in the side bar. That one is worse than conventional, it is REDUNDANT. Two
 *  views of the same picture, one of them strictly worse, and the honest question becomes why the
 *  big one exists at all. Coherence is not repetition.
 *
 *  So the two surfaces split the WORK instead of the picture. The workplace is spatial: it answers
 *  "where is everyone, what is the team doing" and it has no clock. This panel is the desk that
 *  building reports to — every job is a WORK ORDER, impaled on one steel spike, and the spike runs
 *  the whole height of the panel and straight on down through the composer at the bottom. That rod
 *  is the answer to "two products bolted together": everything in the side bar hangs on one piece
 *  of ironmongery, so there are no longer two halves to be incoherent between.
 *
 *  The one idea that makes it more than a nicer list: PAPER SINKS. A spike is physical, so depth in
 *  the pile means something. Live work sits on top at full height; work that is finished, held or
 *  somebody else's is pressed down into a sliver you can still read a name off. Vertical space is
 *  therefore allocated by DEMAND FOR ATTENTION rather than handed out equally per row — which is the
 *  behaviour a 220px column actually needs, and the one thing a list structurally cannot do.
 *
 *  Coherence with the workplace is STRUCTURAL, not cosmetic: the people, their deterministic faces,
 *  the pod-colour assignment, the status marks and the sleep mark are imported from
 *  `webview/workplace/` and rendered by the workplace's own pixel engine. The same rectangles make
 *  the same person in both views.
