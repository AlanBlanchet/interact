/** The PLAN: a building with a spine, not a partition of a rectangle.
 *
 *  The version this replaces solved the floor by cutting one square into a 3x3 grid and giving
 *  each department a cell. Every room therefore came out the same size, the same shape and the
 *  same way up, corridors were whatever was left over, and the whole thing read — correctly — as
 *  a floor plan with pixel art painted on it. No amount of nicer tiles fixes that, because the
 *  defect is in the GENERATOR: a partition function can only ever produce a partition.
 *
 *  So the building is now composed the way a building is:
 *
 *   - a HALL runs through it, from the front gate to the chamber at its head. It has its own
 *     ground and a runner down the middle, so a passage looks nothing like the places it joins.
 *   - rooms BUD off the hall, north and south, sharing party walls. Each one is as WIDE as its
 *     headcount and as DEEP as its trade, so the band has a ragged back and the building has a
 *     silhouette. Where a shallow room leaves space behind it, that space is either the building's
 *     structural mass or an ALCOVE the room keeps for itself — which is where the L-shaped rooms
 *     come from, and where the one-of-a-kind things stand.
 *   - the wall a room FACES is two tiles: the cap you look down on and the face you look at.
 *     A one-tile band on all four sides is a border; a wall with a visible face is a wall, and it
 *     is the single cheapest thing that makes a room stop being a rectangle.
 *   - the CHAMBER at the head of the hall is not a room at all: no walls, a colonnade, a raised
 *     dais. Every route to the west half crosses it, which is the org chart drawn as architecture.
 *
 *  What a room CONTAINS comes from what its people can actually DO. A department whose members
 *  mostly run commands gets a machine room; one whose members only read gets the stacks. The
 *  faculties are read off each agent's own definition file, ranked by how much they distinguish
 *  that department from the rest of the company, and the top one picks the archetype. Nothing is
 *  keyed to a department NAME, so a company file with different departments furnishes itself.

     what makes the gaps between them read as clearings), it is GRADED (thick at the boundary of
     the site, thin where people walk), and it has more than one kind of thing in it. So:

       - a made PATH out of the gate, with lamps along it, because the way in should look like a
         way in and not a gap in a wall;
       - copses seeded at jittered centres, each one a handful of pieces scattered around it —
         the cluster is the unit, never the cell;
       - a thicker fringe at the edges of the site, which is what stops the world's border being
         a straight line where the drawing simply stops;
       - a pond, some rock, some flowers, and tufts of longer grass at low density so the lawn
         has texture the ground pattern alone cannot carry at this pitch.
