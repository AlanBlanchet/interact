/** The simulation: bodies that occupy tiles, a camera that watches them, and a floor that is
 *  never completely still.
 *
 *  Position belongs to the engine, not to the document. A body owns a tile coordinate; the DOM
 *  element is only where it happens to be drawn this frame. From that one inversion everything
 *  else follows:
 *
 *   - **Routes are computed, not guessed.** A breadth-first search over the walkability grid finds
 *     the way out of a room, along the hall and in through another room's door. It cannot cut
 *     through a wall or stand inside a desk, because those cells are simply not in the graph.
 *   - **Movement has a cause and it is usually INTERACTION.** One agent messaging another sends
 *     the sender across the building to say it and back again. Nobody teleports.
 *   - **Nothing is ever still.** Everyone has an errand loop of their own, staggered per person.
 *   - **Footfall is keyed to DISTANCE, not to a clock**, so a body that speeds up keeps its stride.
 *
 *  What is new here is the CAMERA and the two things it pays for.
 *
 *  The view this replaces scaled the whole building down until it fitted the panel, which in the
 *  side bar it actually ships in meant half scale: eighteen-pixel people and six-pixel capability
 *  marks. Fitting everything into frame is the one thing a game never does. So the frame is now
 *  bounded and the camera goes to the work — a weighted centroid of whoever is walking, talking or
 *  delivering, chased through a dead zone so it never jitters and never chases noise.
 *
 *  Because only eight or nine people are on screen at a time, two things become affordable that
 *  were not: the capability marks can be drawn at a size somebody can read, and everyone's line
 *  can be SHOWN rather than hidden behind a hover. The bubbles are placed here, on three levels,
 *  and any that would collide with another bubble or with somebody's nameplate is simply not
 *  shown — which is a guarantee, not a hope, because it is computed.

/* ── the camera ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The building is bigger than the panel on purpose. Left alone the camera holds a weighted
   centroid of whoever is doing something — delivering a message outranks walking, walking
   outranks standing — and chases it through a DEAD ZONE, so it moves when the work moves and
   holds perfectly still when it does not.

   What is new here is that the SURVEY is the resting truth. The camera used to open FOLLOWING
   at a close rung, and following plus ambient walking is what ate aimed clicks: the floor
   panned under the pointer between the press and the release. Now the panel opens on the WHOLE
   FLOOR, following is opt-in, and the moment a pointer goes down the camera holds still.

   THE SCALE LADDER, which is the thing that makes pulling back possible at all. A tile is
   sixteen source pixels drawn at thirty-two, so one source pixel is two device pixels at zoom
   one. Every rung here is a HALF, which lands one source pixel on a whole number of device
   pixels at every rung — 1/2 draws it one wide, 1 draws it two, 3/2 three, up to six. A ladder
   of arbitrary fractions (0.75, 0.4) smears every hard edge this substrate is made of; halves
   are the ladder this art is exact on. The one licensed exception is the whole-floor FIT in a
   panel too narrow even for the bottom rung — seeing the company beats a perfect pixel there,
   and the far view is a signed plan, not something anybody reads sprites on. */

/* ── THE CAMERA MOVES; IT DOES NOT CUT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  "The zoom could be smoother." It was not smooth in the strict sense: it was INSTANT. A rung is
 *  a third, so stepping one is a 33-50% change of scale applied in a single frame, and a mouse
 *  wheel emits one event per detent — so the whole ladder could be run in a flick, as nine cuts.
 *
 *  The fix is NOT a continuous scale. Every rung lands one source pixel on a whole number of
 *  device pixels, which is the only reason this scene stays crisp below 1x, and giving that up
 *  would smear every hard edge in the building to buy an animation. So the camera is split in
 *  two:
 *
 *    CAM   the LOGICAL camera. Rung-quantised, moved instantly by every handle there is — a
 *          wheel, a key, the rule, the plan, whole-floor. Every reading anything takes of the
 *          camera is this one, so the gauge lights the moment you touch it and the state the
 *          rest of the view derives (near or far, following or held) never flickers mid-move.
 *
 *    VIEW  what is actually PAINTED. It chases CAM every frame, and the chase is what you see.
 *
 *  Two details that matter more than the easing curve:
 *
 *   - SCALE IS CHASED IN LOG SPACE. Interpolating 1/3 to 3 linearly spends most of the move at
 *     the wide end and reads as a lurch; a constant ratio per unit time is what "zooming at an
 *     even rate" actually is.
 *   - IT LANDS EXACTLY, AND ROUNDS ONLY THERE. In flight the transform is left fractional,
 *     because snapping the translate to whole pixels while the scale is moving is a stutter you
 *     can see. Within a fifth of a percent of the target it snaps to the rung and rounds — so the
 *     picture is exact whenever it is still, which is when anybody is actually reading it.
