/** The scene: a building, and the people in it, seen through a WINDOW.
 *
 *  Three layers, and the split is the point.
 *
 *  The MAP is a pure function of the room table — it does not change when the team does — so it is
 *  rendered once and never re-sent. The ACTORS are the only thing a snapshot produces, a few
 *  hundred bytes rather than the whole building, which is what lets the panel push a new scene
 *  several times a second without the floor flickering. The VIEW is a bounded viewport the engine
 *  moves: the building is deliberately bigger than the panel, and the camera goes to where the
 *  work is.
 *
 *  That last one is not a nicety. The view this replaces scaled the WHOLE building down to fit
 *  whatever width it was given, so in the side bar it actually ships in it settled at half scale:
 *  characters eighteen pixels tall, capability marks SIX pixels across, and half the panel empty
 *  underneath. Fitting everything into the frame is the one thing a game never does.
 *
 *  Nothing here positions a person. An actor carries the SEAT it belongs to and nothing else; the
 *  simulation owns where a body actually is and may have it somewhere else entirely at the moment
 *  this markup lands.

 *
 *  The camera took the overview away and gave back a 96px plan you could click, which is where
 *  this went wrong: the plan was `aria-hidden`, it carried no label, no cursor story and no
 *  scale, and the SCALE ITSELF was not a control at all — it was derived from the panel width
 *  and clamped to whole numbers, so the smallest view possible was two thirds of the building.
 *  A reader could neither pull back nor tell that dragging was allowed. The gesture existed and
 *  the affordance did not, which is an ergonomic failure and not a missing feature.
 *
 *  So the plan becomes a survey sheet, and it carries the instruments a survey sheet carries:
 *
 *    the plan        rooms as shapes, a dot per person, a box for where you are looking —
 *                    click it or DRAG it to go there
 *    the scale rule  the zoom ladder drawn as what it is, a rule of ascending scale marks, with
 *                    the rung you are on lit and a cap at each end
 *    whole floor     the bottom of the ladder plus a centred frame: the whole company, once
 *    follow          the latch that says whether the camera is chasing the work or you are
 *                    holding it, because a camera that silently takes itself back is worse than
 *                    one that never moved
 *
 *  Rejected: a floating +/-/fit pill in the corner, which is what every map on the web ships and
 *  therefore what I would have drawn for any project at all; and putting the controls in the top
 *  strip, which re-adds the dashboard chrome the previous round deleted and splits "where am I
 *  looking" across two corners of the same frame.
