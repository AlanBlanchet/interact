/* ── People ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  The body is drawn to the small-sprite craft rules, because the owner's complaint — "not like
 *  any other game" — was precisely that it broke them. The rules this set is authored against,
 *  each checkable on the grid:
 *
 *   - CHIBI COMMITTED: an eight-wide rounded head on an eight-wide body, ~2.3 heads tall. A big
 *     head on realist proportions is the amateur tell; a big head on a small body is a style.
 *   - RAMPS, NOT FILLS: every material carries a lit and a shaded step besides its base — one
 *     warm light out of the north-west, one cool shade toward the south-east, the same two tints
 *     for every material so twenty palettes still read as one person under one sun.
 *   - LIMBS ARE CHUNKY: legs two pixels wide, boots three — a one-pixel limb cannot hold a ramp
 *     and reads as a stick. Hands are skin mittens, no fingers at this size.
 *   - THE FACE IS TWO DOT EYES. A mouth at ten pixels wide is noise; the eyes plus the hair
 *     framing the face are what read as a face. The lids close for a blink frame.
 *   - NOTHING SYMMETRIC IS TRULY SYMMETRIC: the light breaks the symmetry (lit left shoulder,
 *     shaded right), which is what stops the pose reading as a toy soldier.

/* ── Sitting down ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  The state of a run used to be a WORD on a placard over a standing body: DONE, HELD, NOT OURS,
 *  stamped on everybody, all the time. "All the agents say finished whereas we don't care —
 *  instead they could have a seat or rest in their room."
 *
 *  So the body carries the ordinary states and the placard is kept for the two that actually want
 *  a person: ERROR and ASKED. Which means the sprite sheet needs postures, and a posture is worth
 *  authoring only if it reads at 30x42 across a room:
 *
 *    SIT     forward, elbows out to the desk, knees toward you. Working.
 *    SLUMP   the same seat with the head sunk into the shoulders and the eyes shut. Stopped.
 *    LOUNGE  leaned back, arms along the back of the bench, legs stretched. Done, and at ease.
 *
 *  All three are 14 rows against the standing figure's 16, and every sprite is anchored at the
 *  boots — so sitting down literally lowers the head six pixels and the difference is visible
 *  before any of the detail is.
