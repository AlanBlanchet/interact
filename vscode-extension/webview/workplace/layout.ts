/** Where everyone stands, worked out before a single rectangle is drawn.

 *  The hard part of this view is not the art, it is that two rules fight each other: a worker
 *  stands in the ROOM their work is in, and a report stands WITH its lead. A researcher out at the
 *  mast is doing both — they are outside the building and they still answer to a manager on the
 *  first floor.
 *
 *  Resolved by making the pod a thing you can be AWAY from. A pod is anchored where its lead is;
 *  members in that same room stand on the lead's platform, and a member somewhere else stands in
 *  their own room on a small platform in the lead's colour, while the lead's platform keeps their
 *  empty footprint with an arrow to where they went. Nothing is drawn between rooms: at fifteen
 *  workers a wire per relationship is the node graph this view exists to not be.
