/** A backtick inside a comment ends the template literal holding an embedded stylesheet or script.
 *
 *  Everything after it is then parsed as TypeScript, and tsc reports a syntax error on a line that
 *  looks like a comment — a confusing place to be told about a broken string. It has cost six
 *  build cycles in one session, so this runs FIRST and says what actually happened.
 *
 *  Two earlier versions of this guard each missed a real break:
 *
 *   - a hardcoded file list missed `webview/workplace/sim.ts`, which embeds the simulation exactly
 *     as `style.ts` embeds the stylesheet — nobody remembered to add it, so a guard written for
 *     this failure sat and watched it happen. Files carrying `String.raw` are discovered now.
 *   - scanning stopped at the first closing backtick, which missed `motion.ts` entirely: its
 *     source is CONCATENATED (a template, then SIM, then another template), so everything after
 *     the first segment went unchecked. The scan tracks template state instead of guessing.
