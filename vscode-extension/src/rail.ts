/** The rail: what the panel shows at rest, decided without a `vscode` import.
 *
 *  This is the chosen replacement for the tree + chat split, and the reason it must be a webview
 *  rather than a `TreeView` is measured, not stylistic: VS Code hides a view's title actions until
 *  the pointer enters the header (`.pane-header > .actions { display: none }`) and CLIPS the
 *  overflow with no "…" menu to recover from. So a resting panel rendered ZERO buttons, and the
 *  team view — the thing most worth reaching — could only be found by hovering and guessing among
 *  unlabelled glyphs. No arrangement of icons fixes that inside a tree, at any width. A webview
 *  draws its own chrome, which can simply be visible.
 *
 *  Two decisions live here, and they are what make this a SUPERVISION surface rather than a list:
 *
 *  - the roster is ordered by WHO NEEDS YOU, not by identity. With a couple of dozen seats and ten
 *    runs, alphabetical order buries the one thing that went wrong somewhere in the middle;
 *  - the destinations are LABELLED. An icon you have to hover to identify is not a destination,
 *    it is a guess.
