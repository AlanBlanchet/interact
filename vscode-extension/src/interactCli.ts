/** One way to ask the `interact` CLI a question.
 *
 *  This call was written ten times across the extension with ten different levels of care — one
 *  set a timeout, none set `maxBuffer`, several dropped the error entirely. That divergence is not
 *  cosmetic: a hung binary with no timeout leaves whatever guard the caller set stuck forever, and
 *  a swallowed error is indistinguishable from a legitimate empty answer, so a panel caches
 *  "nothing" and re-caches "nothing" every refresh with no line anywhere saying why.
 *
 *  So: always a timeout, always a buffer ceiling, always a single place that can log. Never
 *  rejects — every caller here wants "what did it say, and did it work", not an exception in a
 *  repaint path.
