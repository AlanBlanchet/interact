/** Which agents the panel is looking at.
 *
 *  It used to look at all of them, always: the workplace rendered every run on the machine with no
 *  notion of where you are, and the tree only GROUPED by project, which is not the same as being
 *  able to look at one. Opening a folder and seeing that folder's team is the default anyone would
 *  expect; being able to switch to another one — a team running in some other checkout — is the
 *  thing that makes the panel a supervisor rather than a log.
