/** The rail's decisions: what the panel shows at rest, and in what order.
 *
 *  Why a rail at all is measured rather than stylistic. VS Code hides a view's title actions until
 *  the pointer enters the header and CLIPS the overflow with no "…" menu, so the panel rendered
 *  ZERO buttons at rest and the team view could only be found by hovering and guessing among
 *  unlabelled glyphs. No arrangement of icons fixes that inside a `TreeView` at any width.
 *
 *  The two decisions worth pinning are the ones that make this a supervision surface rather than
 *  a list: the roster is ordered by WHO NEEDS YOU, and the destinations carry words.
