/** The chat panel's control surface.
 *

 *  slash menu in the panel itself. interact's panel could only send a string: stopping the agent
 *  you were reading, starting another, switching workspace, opening the team — all of it lived in
 *  a tree context menu or the command palette. That is what "i can't control everything from
 *  there" means.
 *
 *  Declared as DATA so one list drives the menu, the typed-slash completion and the buttons, and
 *  so a test can hold every entry to invoking a command that genuinely exists.
