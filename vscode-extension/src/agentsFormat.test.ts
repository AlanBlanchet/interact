/** The Agents sidebar's pure logic, tested without VS Code.
 *
 *  The tree itself needs the `vscode` module (only available inside the extension host), so the
 *  grouping / labelling / formatting decisions live as exported pure functions and are pinned
 *  here. Run with: node --experimental-strip-types --test src/agentsView.test.ts
 *
 *  These exist because the panel's whole job is to tell the truth at a glance: an unknown cost
 *  rendered as "$0.00" claims a run was free, and a group that hides live work defeats the point
 *  of a sidebar.
