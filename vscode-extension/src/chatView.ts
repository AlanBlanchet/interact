/** The Chat view — the side-bar surface you TALK to an agent from.
 *
 *  The tree lists what is running; the conversation tab shows what happened. Both are windows.
 *  This one is a conversation: it sits under the agent list in the same side-bar container, shows
 *  the selected agent's transcript, and has a composer that sends a message back. The agent
 *  resumes its own session, so it answers with everything it has already done still in context.
 *
 *  Sending shells out to `interact agents send` rather than reimplementing delivery: the CLI and
 *  the MCP tool share one set of refusals (an unknown run, one of your own editor sessions, a
 *  provider that cannot resume), and this must not drift from them.
