/**
 * WCAG contrast over the workplace's own colour algebra.
 *
 * The workplace paints text on translucent plates that sit over room art, so a plate's
 * effective contrast is a COMPOSITE — it depends on what is behind it and on any opacity
 * applied to an ancestor. Two contrast defects shipped on this surface because that stack
 * was judged by eye (and once by a computed-style read, which cannot see an ancestor's
 * `opacity` at all). This module makes the stack computable so a test can hold the floor.
