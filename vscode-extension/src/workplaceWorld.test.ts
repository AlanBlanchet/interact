/** The building is now a TILE MAP solved from the company's departments, so what is worth
 *  guarding changed with it.
 *
 *  The old guard here asserted `data-vacant` on a flexbox storey; those storeys no longer exist,
 *  and a test that asserts an absent selector does not fail, it ERRORS — which is how the
 *  contrast guard beside it went silently missing while still looking present. So these assert
 *  the properties the tile world actually rests on, all of which have already been broken once
 *  during this build:
 *
 *   - every department the roster names gets a room, and nobody is placed in a room the company
 *     never declared;
 *   - a room is SIZED to its headcount, because a fixed room silently stacks the extra people on
 *     top of each other (six critics were drawn as one pile);
 *   - every seat is WALKABLE — a seat generated onto a wall tile put a body inside the masonry,
 *     which happened the first time the bays were made variable;
 *   - every room is REACHABLE from every other one through the doors, because a body that cannot
 *     path to its own desk simply never moves, and a still character is indistinguishable from
 *     a still view.
