"""Track running MCP servers so the CLI can flag a STALE one.

A long-lived ``interact mcp`` process keeps the CODE it imported at startup. After the package
advances (an editable checkout especially — source is live but a running process is not), that
server silently serves OLD code until it is reconnected. This is the trap behind "I shipped the
fix but the bug persists": the maintainer's fix is committed, yet the editor's long-lived MCP
server still runs the pre-fix code.

Each server records its pid + version under ``<debug_dir>/runtime/`` at startup; ``interact
doctor``/``status`` read these, prune dead pids, and flag any LIVE server whose version is behind
the latest — naming the pid so the user knows exactly which editor connection to reconnect.
