"""The agent-mesh MCP tools: spawn a teammate, see the team, read what one is doing, stop it.

These are what make cross-provider teamwork ordinary. A spawned agent gets interact declared as
one of its own MCP servers, so ``agent_spawn`` is available to a Claude agent and a Codex agent
alike — they meet on MCP, vendor-neutral. An agent spawning an agent is therefore not a special
case, just one of these calls — the parent id travels automatically, keeping the team tree
connected.

    """Start another agent to work alongside you, and return its run id immediately.

    Runs as its own process on this machine, using the vendor CLI's own login — you never handle
    a credential. Given interact as an MCP server, so it can call these same tools: it can spawn
    agents of its own, including from a DIFFERENT provider than yours.

    Returns as soon as the agent is alive, not when it finishes — use agent_list / agent_events
    to watch it, agent_stop to end it.

    profile: one of the OPERATOR's own named profiles (INTERACT_PROFILE_* in ~/.interact/config.env)
        deciding what this agent runs on — e.g. a local Ollama model for a cheap critic while a
        reviewer stays on a frontier one. A profile resolves to a fixed, allow-listed set of
        variables; you cannot pass an environment, and an unknown name is refused rather than
        silently ignored.

    session_id: owning caller conversation, shared by spawn and list. Omit only when a
        recorded parent or INTERACT_SESSION_ID provides it. No cwd or MCP transport inference.
    task: what the agent should do — write it as a complete brief; the agent cannot ask you.
    provider: which CLI to run ("claude", "codex"). Only installed ones can be used.
    agent: a definition the CLI resolves itself — Claude Code reads ~/.claude/agents/<name>.md —
        so the run IS that agent (e.g. "code-reviewer"), with its own system prompt and tools.
        The run is named after it, which is what makes a team readable at a glance.
    name: a short role label for the supervisor view. Defaults to the agent definition, then to
        the provider — so several runs are not all just called "claude".
    model: does not override a configured role policy. Edit the rule in the agent UI instead.
        A named agent and a satisfiable role criterion are required; no silent model fallback.
    cwd: directory to work in; defaults to interact's own working directory.
    permission_mode: how much the agent may do on its own. Provider-specific and validated —
        agent_providers lists what each CLI accepts. Claude Code: "plan" (works out an approach,
        touches nothing), "manual", "auto", "acceptEdits", "dontAsk". Omit to leave the CLI's own
        configured default alone. Modes that act WITHOUT ASKING cannot be set from here — a person
        chooses those for themselves, from the CLI or the panel.
    image_paths: optional absolute paths to existing PNG, JPEG, or WebP files to attach to the
        initial prompt. The provider must support native image attachments and the resolved model
        must meet cap.vlm; paths are bounded and validated before spawn.
    agent_ref: exact server agent identity and revision. Both prompt and model policy come from
        this revision, never the current head. Conflicts with a parent's capability pin fail.
    delegate: name of a delegate capability on the parent run's recorded revision. Its exact
        agent reference is resolved automatically. Named-role delegation also honours parent pins.
