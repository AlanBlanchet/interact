Four asks, one shape. A PROFILE is a model rule written once, worn by many agents; a TOOLSET is a
set of tools named once instead of spelling `mcp__interact__…` at every call site; a PARADIGM
assignment is instruction content written once and PROJECTED per agent, choosing whether that
agent carries it always (`system_prompt`) or loads it on demand (`skill`) — same content,
different altitude per agent; a PROVIDER switch says whether interact drives agents through that
vendor at all. Each is a NAME standing for something you'd otherwise repeat, so they share one
file and one grammar instead of four conventions to remember.

Everything is validated when the file is READ — unknown profile, toolset cycle, unknown
projection kind — because the alternative is discovering it at 3am when that agent spawns.
