/** The look of the board.
 *
 *  Three rules run through all of it, and two of them are the workplace's own — deliberately, since
 *  the whole point of this panel is that it is the same world seen from a different desk.
 *
 *  COLOUR follows the editor. Paper, ink, steel and the printed rules are mixed from `--vscode-*`
 *  tokens, so the board is a warm dark card in a dark theme and a cream one in a light theme with
 *  no second palette existing anywhere. Only the people keep literal tones, which is why they are
 *  the one thing imported from the workplace unchanged.
 *
 *  MOTION follows one beat. Every ambient duration is an integer ratio of `--beat`, so a board full
 *  of live work moves as ONE thing rather than as six independent loops. The easing is declared
 *  inside the keyframes as well as on the shorthand, because `getComputedTiming().easing` reports
 *  `linear` for every CSS animation and the real value only survives on the keyframe.
 *
 *  PAPER IS A SILHOUETTE, NOT A BRIGHTNESS. The temptation with a paper metaphor is to make the
 *  slips white, and twelve white cards in a dark side bar is glare, not craft. So what makes these
 *  read as paper is the die-cut: the punch hole with a steel rod behind it, the binding gutter, the
 *  perforation between parts of the form, the tear on a job that died, the curled corner on one
 *  nobody has been back to. The fill can then follow the theme all the way down, which it does.
 *  Same reasoning as the workplace's derived ink rim — the shape carries the reading, so the colour
 *  is free to follow the editor.
