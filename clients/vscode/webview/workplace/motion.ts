  /* ── steering ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     Every way a person might reasonably try to move a map, wired to the same camera.

     What was here before was ONE of them — drag the floor — with no affordance beyond a grab
     cursor, and it undid itself six seconds later. So the reader could not pull back (there was
     no zoom control of any kind), could not tell panning was allowed, and could not keep a view
     they had found. Now:

       drag the floor          pan, and the frame keeps a grab cursor plus a HOLDING latch that
                               says out loud the camera is yours
       wheel over the floor    zoom about the pointer, so the desk under the cursor stays there
       the rule                click a mark, or drag along it, to set the scale outright
       + and -                 one rung at a time, on the buttons and on the keys
       0                       the whole company, framed

       f                       hand the camera back to the work

     Taking the camera is IMPLICIT (any of the above) and giving it back is EXPLICIT (the latch,
     or f). That asymmetry is the whole ergonomic argument: a reader who moves the map meant to,
     and a reader who wants the work back can always see how to ask for it. */
