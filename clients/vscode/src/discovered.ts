 *  These have no record on disk. They are found by asking each provider at list time, so a panel
 *  that reads the registry DIRECTORY (this one does, and should: it is a file read, not a
 *  subprocess, on every refresh) could never see one — while carrying a status icon and a tooltip
 *  for them the whole time. "i have agents in the 'sheets' folder elsewhere, and i can't change
 *  and see how they work" was literally true: the panel had no way to learn they existed.
 *
 *  So the fast path stays a file read, and this adds the discovered ones from `interact agents
 *  discovered` on a slow cadence — editor windows open and close on a human timescale, not on a
 *  refresh timer, and paying a subprocess per repaint to track that would be the wrong trade.
