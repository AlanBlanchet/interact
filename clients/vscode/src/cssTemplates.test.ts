/** A backtick inside a comment silently ends the template literal that holds an embedded
 *  stylesheet or script, and everything after it is then parsed as TypeScript. I have done this
 *  six times in one session, and the build fails with a message about an unexpected token hundreds
 *  of lines further down, pointing at code that is fine.
 *
 *  This tests the SAME implementation the build runs (`scripts/check-css-templates.js`) rather
 *  than a second copy of the algorithm. The copy was the earlier design, and the two drifted:
 *  every synthetic case here passed while the real check missed `motion.ts` completely.
 *
 *  Three generations of this guard each shipped a defect the tests below now pin:
 *   - matching only lines that START a comment sailed past a backtick on a middle line;
 *   - stopping at the first closing backtick missed a file whose source is CONCATENATED;
 *   - starting the scan at the first backtick began inside the module docstring and inverted
 *     every state after it, condemning six lines of a file that compiles perfectly.
