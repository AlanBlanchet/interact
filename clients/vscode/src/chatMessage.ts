/** What a chat surface accepts from its webview.
 *
 *  There are two chat surfaces now — the sidebar view and the full editor-area page — rendering
 *  the same document. These rules used to be inline in the sidebar's provider, which is exactly
 *  how a second surface grows a weaker copy of a security check: the panel renders AGENT OUTPUT,
 *  so every message arriving from it is untrusted, and a command executed because a message named
 *  it would be a real hole.
 *
 *  Deliberately free of `vscode`, so it can be unit-tested without an extension host.
