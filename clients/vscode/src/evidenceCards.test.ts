/** One visual language for everything an agent SHOWS you.
 *
 *  His words: "We can see the full code piece that was changed in the conversation... instead, how
 *  others do it is they show a box, and when we click on it it opens the code diff in the file...
 *  You have to check how it is also for other things like when screenshots are taken / shown, or
 *  even the 'thinking'... We globally need to have a theme and unique way of showing info."
 *
 *  So every non-speech event is the SAME kind of card: a glyph, a one-line headline, a payload
 *  that is collapsed or lives behind a click — never a wall of source dumped into the transcript.
