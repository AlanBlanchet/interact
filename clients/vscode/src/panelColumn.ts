/** Where interact's editor-tab surfaces open.
 *
 *  Two failures bracket this, and the fix for the first caused the second:
 *
 *   - the team used to open in `ViewColumn.Active`, taking over the editor group holding your
 *     code — so the thing you were reading vanished behind a pixel-art building;
 *   - making all of them `Beside` fixed that and introduced sprawl: team, sequence and dashboard
 *     each opened their OWN new group, so two clicks left the window four or five columns wide and
 *     visibly squeezed the side panel.
 *
 *  So: the FIRST interact surface goes beside your code, and every later one joins it there,
 *  stacking as tabs in one column instead of breeding columns.
