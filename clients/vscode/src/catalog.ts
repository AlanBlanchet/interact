/** The live model catalog, as the panel sees it.
 *
 *  The extension used to read `./models.json` — a file baked into the bundle by `sync-data.js` at
 *  BUILD time. It looked current and wasn't: prices and context windows aged with every release
 *  and nothing said so. This reads the catalog Python refreshes
 *  (`interact.model_catalog`, `~/.interact/out/model_catalog.json`) and, when that is missing or
 *  stale, fetches OpenRouter's public endpoint directly — a plain unauthenticated GET, no key.
 *
 *  The invariant, same as the Python side: the catalog carries its SOURCE and its AGE, and
 *  `isLive` goes false for anything stale. Serving old data offline is fine; serving it as
 *  today's truth is the bug.
