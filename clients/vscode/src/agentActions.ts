/** What you can DO with a character, decided from what that character actually is.
 *
 *  Every action in the panel used to be global: stop, message, show events, reached from a tree
 *  context menu and offered identically whether the run was live or had finished a day ago.
 *  Clicking a character in the world offered nothing at all.
 *
 *  Two rules, and both are about not lying:
 *
 *   - an action is offered only when it would WORK. Stopping a finished agent is not an action,
 *     it is a dead menu item, and one of those teaches you the whole menu is untrustworthy;
 *   - one of your own editor sessions can be READ but not driven. interact does not supervise it,
 *     so offering "message" would promise a reach the product does not have.
 *
 *  No `vscode` import: the decision is testable, and the caller executes the command.
