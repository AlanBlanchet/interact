/** How a worker's status is SPOKEN — one vocabulary, every surface.
 *
 *  visual-critic, twice: the rail and the workplace carry the same taxonomy in two unrelated
 *  visual languages — the rail says a green `✓` and lowercase "finished" in a flat list row, the
 *  world stamps a tilted uppercase "DONE" on paper. Same five states, two products. Its verdict
 *  was that this split "undercuts the 'one game' read the moment a user sees both panels
 *  together," and that it is very likely part of what Alan called "the environment is weird."
 *
 *  So the vocabulary lives here once and both surfaces render it in their own idiom: the world
 *  stamps the WORD on paper, the rail prints the same word beside the same MARK in the same
 *  ACCENT. Idiom may differ; the words, marks and colours may not.
 *
 *  `mark` carries the meaning by SHAPE before colour — colour alone is unreadable to a good share
 *  of people and invisible in a screenshot glanced at across a desk.
